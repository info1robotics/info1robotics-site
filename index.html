      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        We are the infO(1)Robotics Team – RO 140 - from “Ion Luca Caragiale”
        High - School, Ploiesti, Romania. Our team started its actions on April
        2018, and it is coordinated by our main mentor Daniela Lica, a Computer
        – Programming teacher. Our team is composed of 15 members and 36
        volunteers and each of them is currently working in the STEM fields with
        extracurricular activities which fit their sub-teams. Our team started
        with no budget and has been gradually building up its financial
        resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        infO(1)Robotics is currently participating for the second time at FIRST
        Tech Challenge and expects to consolidate the knowledge accumulated over
        the course of the first year. At the Regionals competition, we were
        awarded with the 2nd place of Inspire Award, but also with the title of
        the 2nd pick in the Winning Alliance. We qualified as the 3rd team to
        the National Stage at which we won the 2nd place of the Control Award.
      </p>
      <p>
        We combine work and pleasure, we always train hard but in an enjoyable
        way. By sharing opinions and learning about team work, we believe we can
        get creative enough to someday find a revolutionary and feasible idea of
        a robot that could unbelievably save humanity in its own way.
